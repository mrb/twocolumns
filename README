Two Columns: The Definitive Source for Definitive Sources
=========================================================

A simple web app to allow for the storage and retrieval of academic papers that
are freely available through various online sources.  The idea came about after
a conversation with a colleage about how it's not easy to find these primary 
sources indexed according to our interests, and usually remembering the titles
and authors is a challenge when remembering concepts or keywords isn't.

The modern web programming community has a lot to learn from the relatively
young but exceedingly well researched and funded past of academic Computer 
Science, and this knowledge should be made available to anyone with internet
access. 

Two columns is written in Rails 3, and is deployed on the Heroku Cedar stack.
