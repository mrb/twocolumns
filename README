Two Columns: The Definitive Source for Definitive Sources
=========================================================

A simple web app to allow for the storage and retrieval of academic papers that
are freely available through various online sources.  The idea came about after
a conversation with a colleage about how it's not easy to find these primary
sources indexed according to our interests, and usually remembering the titles
and authors is a challenge when remembering concepts or keywords isn't.

The modern web programming community has a lot to learn from the relatively
young but exceedingly well researched and funded past of academic Computer
Science, and this knowledge should be made available to anyone with internet
access.

Implementation Details
======================

Two columns is written in Rails 3, and is deployed on the Heroku Cedar stack.

TODO
====
- Allow multiple tag selection/filtering
- Get slug link working so that twocolumns can provide nice permalinks to
  scholarly papers - i.e. twocolumns.org/fielding-rest or /raymond-cathedral
- Decide if we need some kind of auth
- Do some actual interface work (I wish the font could be Computer Modern)
